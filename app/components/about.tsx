      <p className="mt-6 text-center">Iâ€™m Bianca a UI/UX designer and frontend developer based in Costa Rica who believes pixels should behave, layouts should flex, and buttons should never ghost you. I specialize in responsive design, accessibility, and scalable systems that make life easier for users and developers.</p>
      <p className="mt-2.5 text-center">My workflow is powered by equal parts creativity and QA obsession. I love catching edge cases before they cause chaos, prototyping clean interfaces, and building experiences that feel intuitive, inclusive, and just a little bit delightful.</p>
